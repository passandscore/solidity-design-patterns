## Solidity Design Pattens

Each of these categories addresses specific needs within smart contract development, providing standardized ways to solve common challenges and improve contract security, efficiency, and maintainability.

### Creational Patterns
```ml
├─ Factory Pattern — "Used to deploy multiple instances of a contract, often through a single centralized factory contract."
├─ Clone (Minimal Proxy) Pattern — "Reduces gas costs by deploying lightweight instances using EIP-1167 proxies."
├─ Singleton — "Ensures only one instance of a contract is deployed, typically using an access control mechanism."
```

### Structural Patterns
```ml
├─ Proxy Pattern — "Separates storage from logic to enable upgradability (e.g., Transparent Proxy, UUPS Proxy)."
├─ Library Pattern — "Reusable code via Solidity libraries to keep contracts modular and reduce code duplication."
├─ Composite Pattern — "Combines multiple contracts into a single interface, often used for hierarchical relationships."
```

### Behavioral Patterns
```ml
├─ State Machine — "Ensures that a contract follows a defined sequence of states, often used in auctions or crowdsales."
├─ Oracle Pattern — "Allows external data to be fetched and used within a smart contract, often through a trusted source like Chainlink."
├─ Pull Over Push — "Users are responsible for pulling funds from a contract rather than having them automatically pushed, reducing reentrancy risks."
├─ Observer Pattern — "Uses events and subscribers to notify external entities when certain actions occur."
```

### Security Patterns
```ml
├─ Checks-Effects-Interactions — "Prevents reentrancy by updating state variables before interacting with external contracts."
├─ Access Control — "Restricts contract functionality to specific users (e.g., Ownable, Role-based access)."
├─ Emergency Stop — "Adds circuit breakers to disable critical functionality in case of an emergency."
```

### Gas Optimization Patterns
```ml
├─ Packed Storage — "Optimizes storage layout to save gas by minimizing the number of storage slots used."
├─ Lazy Initialization — "Delays contract initialization until it's needed, which can reduce initial deployment costs."
├─ Loop Unrolling — "Reduces loop overhead by explicitly writing out repeated logic."
```

### Economic Patterns
```ml
├─ Withdrawal Pattern — "Ensures user balances are maintained within the contract and withdrawn upon request."
├─ Bonding Curve — "Defines a dynamic price for a token or service based on the demand."
├─ Time-Locking — "Locks assets or contract functionality until a future timestamp."
```

### Upgradeability Patterns
```ml
├─ Proxy and Implementation — "Uses a proxy to delegate calls to an implementation contract that can be replaced."
├─ Eternal Storage — "Keeps storage in a separate contract to maintain state across different logic contract upgrades."
├─ Data Separation — "Separates logic and data contracts to facilitate upgradeability."
```

### Upgradeability Patterns
```ml
├─ Access Restriction — "Defines rules for granting permissions (e.g., onlyOwner, whitelisted)."
├─ Guard Clause — "Uses require statements to validate inputs early and clearly, avoiding nested conditionals."
├─ Commit-Reveal Scheme — "Used for maintaining fairness in auctions or games, where users first commit to an action, and later reveal it."
```
